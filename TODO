TODO List:

* Terminate the dissect command.
   This command does not have much importance. If you need addionally
   details about ELF binary use the readelf unix tool.

* infect
   Add the infect command. This command will help in the process of
   malware development, updating e_entry, p_filesz, p_memsz, etc,
   conforming to the virus atached.
   Example usage: ./malelficus infect -v my_virus.bin -i target_binary
   -o result_infected_binary -t silvio_cesare_standard

* binary2src / src2binary
   soon!
